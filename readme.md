# STRV's Web3 Academy 2022
The world is consumed with web3. Is it the future? Or a fleeting trend? At STRV, we’re betting that web3 will stick around and change the digital world — and that’s why we’ve founded the STRV Web3 team. To spread our knowledge (and maybe get a new colleague or two), we’ve also decided to have our first ever Web3 Academy. So bet on web3 with us and become a Web3 Engineer!

## The Goal of the STRV Academy: Web3
Web3 is taking over, but it’s also still evolving. On top of that, conceptually, it’s very different from web2 — making it quite difficult to learn if you don’t have guidance.

STRV’s Web3 Academy will walk you through the basics and fundamental principles of web3 development. From blockchain, smart contracts, solidity and forge to testing, deployment and integration of smart contracts to your application.

The Web3 Academy will be led by multiple experts from STRV who have real-world experience with Smart contract development and deployment. You can also look forward to an external expert from this field.

This course will be full of live coding, real exercises and hands-on experience. We won’t burden you with a lot of theory — that’s not how we do things.

You’ll get your hands dirty with Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat, Foundry and ChainLink, and will learn about ERC20, ERC721 (NFT), ERC1155 and how to secure and optimize your contracts.

Our goal is to provide you with the best practices we’ve learned, to make you a promising Web3 Engineer and a real problem solver!
And as a bonus: After this course, you should know enough to work at STRV (or any similar company that’s seeking Web3 Engineers). :)
